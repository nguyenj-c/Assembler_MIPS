# Assembler_MIPS

Assembler_MIPS is a directory with all of my exercices and project done for the course about MIPS ( Microprocessor without Interlocked Pipeline Stages ).
For this course, we use a software called [Mars](http://courses.missouristate.edu/KenVollmar/mars/).
This project is related by this other [project](https://github.com/nguyenj-c/Calculator-circuits) done for the same course where we construct a circuit of an calculator.
